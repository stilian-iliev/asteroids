Javascript implementation of the atari 1979 game asteroids.
# Asteroids
The player controls a triangular ship that can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward. Once the ship begins moving in a direction, it will continue in that direction for a time without player intervention unless the player applies thrust in a different direction. The ship eventually comes to a stop when not thrusting. The player can also send the ship into hyperspace, causing it to disappear and reappear in the oposite side of the screen. As the player shoots asteroids, they break into smaller asteroids that are more difficult to hit. Once the screen has been cleared of all asteroids a new set of large asteroids appears, thus starting the next level. The player starts with 3 lives and each time the player hets hit by an asteroid he loses a life.
